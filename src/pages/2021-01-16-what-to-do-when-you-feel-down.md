I can’t lecture you about meaning of life, your purpose, etc. Let’s cut the crap and go straight to the business. When you feel down, you go down. That’s it. If you feel tired, lay down and take a nap. When you feel unproductive, lay down and take a nap! Power naps are called “power naps” for a reason! They literally “power” you. 

I’ve been trying to find a way that would make me work at optimal energy level for the last half a dozen years. And one thing that struck me the most was that the solution to it was all so simple. **Eat when you’re hungry, drink when you’re thirsty and sleep when you’re tired!**

For example, when you are overly excited about something and could not focus on your work, hit the floor and look at the ceiling, or look outside. Don’t try to do anything at that position. Just be there. After a while, you can focus without an issue!
