Yes, please. What else do you want to do with your precious time? Netflix and chill? Get out of here!

“Meditation” and “mindfulness” are might be the only buzzwords that really deserves their “buzz”. It’s just lovely to see how humanity is trying to become better after almost sucking the earth dry and annihilate each other.

If you feel like you’ve been chasing some shiny objects that look very close, yet when you try to grab it, it eludes you like rainbow. Or even after when you accomplish the impossible and actually grab that “rainbow”, your eyes will be set on another shiny fricking object. Well, unless that object is “meditation” itself, you’re doomed to fall into infinite circle of getting thirsty → quenching → rainbow → getting thirsty that you can never leave. But with the meditation, you can actually reach the end of that thirst.
