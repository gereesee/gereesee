Well, let’s keep some things straight from the beginning. Unless you’ve been steadily meditating for years, meditations won’t help you much at the beginning.

You have to combine it with some mental tools to succeed in keeping your attention all day long.

1.	Decide on when to do what
Try to keep a timetable for your work hours, even if you’re allowed to work in flexible hours. Because when your exact work hours are fuzzy, getting into flow will be much harder. 

2.	Decide on what not to do during work hours
It’s crucial that you have clear-set boundaries for what you should not be doing when you’re working. Everything that could divert your attention is no-no during the work hours. It could be reading news, checking social media, or even going down the rabbit hole of Wikipedia hyperlinks (which might seem innocent, but could totally sabotage your work day!) 

3.	Write down the things that distracted you
By doing so, you’re going to have a clear understanding of the tendencies that put you at unproductiveness. And it will be a good trigger for avoiding bad habits of mindless scrolling.

4.	Write down the things that almost got you distracted
Whenever some novel idea of Google Search comes into your mind. Don’t go with it. You’re going to end up in rabbit hole. Just write that down and carry on.
