It happens to all of us. Whether it’s the riot in Capitol, or a breaking news about prime minister of your country stepping down, all of them could leave you over-excited and focus-less. It might be the case because knowing what’s happening to our surrounding community has serious impact to our wellbeing (or survival, if it were the case in the past). No wonder we got so hooked into news, it’s in our survival instinct to know what’s happening around us. But, to be honest, most of the news don’t really have much impact on our daily life. They just become distraction, after a point of just acknowledging you. 

For example, news about the election result really kept my busy/focus-less for a day even though it didn’t have much direct impact on me. I could’ve just see some quick notes about it after-work. Instead, I googled everything about US election system, Joe Biden, etc.
